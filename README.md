# UFOs


## Project Overview

The purpose of the project is to enhance the UFO webpage with filter capability capable of handing several input factors. D3 functionality enables multiple criteria  to be accounted for in a search that produces the necessary result tables for the UFO sightings.

If a new search is necessary, simply click the "Clear Table" button and input in the new desired search criteria. After clicking the "Filter Table" button a new dynamic table will pop-up with the new data tables for UFO sightings matching the search criteria. 

## Summary

One drawback to the design includes not implementing a GitHub pages from the start to publicly display the UFO data in one repository. 

One suggestion would be to develop and automate the html and JavaScript texts to create a faster work interaction between the files. This will allow the UFO data to be displayed in a more streamline manner. Another suggestion would be to perhaps include expert analysis on UFO's preventing conspiracy theories from rising up.
